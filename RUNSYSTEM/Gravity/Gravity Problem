GRAVITY
Problem
Given a room with a width of 10 metres and a height of 20 metres, we place the squared-shaped packages vertically as pictured, each package is 1 metre wide/high. Assuming that on Doomsday, the Earth upside down and the room also rotates in a clockwise direction at an angle of 90 degrees. After rotating, the packages under the action of gravity will fall vertically. What is the biggest distance that a package can fall, and the packages with biggest distance is from which column?
 
Input
The first line contains 1 integer T, which is the number of testcases ( 0 ≤ T ≤ 50 )
After this, there will be T lines, each line containing 10 integers a1, a2, …, a10 representing number of packages for each metre wide/each column in the room ( 0 ≤ ai ≤ 20 )
Output
For each testcase, output 2 lines: the first line is the biggest distance that a package can fall, and the second line is the column from which the biggest-distance package falls
Notice
- Index of the columns starts from 0
- If in a testcase, the biggest distance is 0, the second line must print -1
- If there is more than 1 column that has the biggest-distance packages, print the columns in descending order
