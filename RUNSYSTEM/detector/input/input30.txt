The wonderful cast of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” at Opera Philadelphia’s O17 festival features the splendid lyric tenor Ben Bliss. This rising artist is coming to the Metropolitan Opera next March as Ferrando in a new production of Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte.” Here, in an intimate recital in the crypt of the Church of the Intercession in Harlem, he sings an aria from yet a third Mozart opera, “The Abduction from the Seraglio.” Belmonte, a young nobleman, is anticipating reuniting with his beloved, who has been the captive of a Turkish pasha. Listen to Mr. Bliss’s delivery of the music’s most fretful passage: He manages to convey emotional distress while singing with elegant lyricism.
