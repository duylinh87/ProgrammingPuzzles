Most of the time, the fastest way to get anywhere in San Francisco is not Uber or Lyft or the ever-delayed Muni system, but on a bicycle. As long as you can handle the quad-busting hills and your reflexes are fast enough to dodge the occasional texting driver, there's no better way to traverse the city.
As GoBike cycle-sharing stands pop up all over the city, I've been riding more and more. I have this problem, though: I don't know how to get anywhere. All too often, I ride with one hand on the handlebars and the other digging into my pocket, or holding my phone, as I try to figure out my next turn.
And so when I tried on Google's new connected jacket, I instantly understood the appeal. The jacket—technically Levi's Commuter Trucker Jacket with Jacquard by Google—is the result of a years-long partnership between Levi's and Google to integrate a conductive, connected yarn into a garment. It's still early days, but the jacket offers a glimpse into what might happen when we start connecting our clothes to the internet.
