When Google designed the blobs nearly half a decade ago, the emoji landscape had already begun to coalesce around the perfectly round circles seen on iOS. Android emoji, by comparison, were delightfully kooky.
“I had a Japanese code name for them: ponyon,” says Satoe Haile, a designer at Google who, along with the contracted Japanese design firm IC4, helped conceptualize the blob. Ponyon roughly translates to the “sound of something bouncing,” which aptly described the emoji’s jubilant, non-human form. The designers intentionally illustrated the blobs so they would be lighthearted and expressive, even when their faces were grumpy or sad. “We wanted to create something cute,” Haile says.
At the time, this winking attitude made sense. It was 2013, and emoji weren’t the loaded graphics they are today. It would be another year before emoji would show up in an official White House economic report; two years before :D would become the Oxford dictionary’s word of the year.
Soon after the blobs first appeared, though, the way people used emoji started to change. “We noticed that emoji were no longer these cutesy, highly-branded things that everybody could go out and design in crazy ways,” says Gus Fonts, a product manager for Android. “But rather, they'd become this really essential tool for communication.”
