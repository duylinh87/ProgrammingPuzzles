Nadella and other Microsoft executives are optimistic about their prospects in quantum hardware. No one has built a quantum computer large enough to be useful because the delicate quantum effects qubits rely on also make them prone to errors. Microsoft is betting on its Majorana-powered qubits because theory suggests that they will be more reliable. The project’s leaders predict they can quickly overtake competitors such as Google once they have a working qubit in hand.
Whatever form quantum computers take, making money from them will require convincing programmers to write code for the devices, just as with conventional computers. Microsoft says it wants coders to familiarize themselves with quantum algorithms and start thinking about quantum killer apps now, to get ready for the hardware.
Microsoft's new quantum programming language is offered via the company’s popular Visual Studio toolkit, used for writing desktop and mobile apps for Windows and other platforms. The language taps into features of Visual Studio that help programmers keep track of the different parts of code, and avoid bugs. Microsoft also plans to offer tools that allow developers to simulate collections of qubits on their computers, or in the cloud, so they have somewhere to test their quantum code.
